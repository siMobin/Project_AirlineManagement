      <h4>This entire site was made as a CSE project.</h4>
      <p>This project was made to incorporate and apply our knowledge for a student project. But as we went on we started to see the flaws of other services and missing features which we decided to apply to our project as well. Which resulted this website having many innovative features that other sites might lack which allows the user to have an intuitive and convenient experience using our site.</p>
